I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [School of Artificial Intelligence](ai.bnu.edu.cn), Beijing Normal University under the guidance of Prof. [Hua Huang](https://vmcl.bnu.edu.cn/group/teacher/dcdaea79b5e54b75b532795109a85a34.htm). Previously, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from the School of Electronic Engineering, Xidian University, in June 2021, under the supervision of Prof. [Xinbo Gao](https://see.xidian.edu.cn/faculty/xbgao/) and Prof. Jie Li.

My research interests broadly include image and video processing, computer vision, and machine learning. Specifically, I focus on image super-resolution, (infrared) image denoising, multimodal fusion, invertible neural networks, etc.
